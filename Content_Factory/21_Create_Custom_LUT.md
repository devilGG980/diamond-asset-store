# How to Create a Custom Color Preset (LUT) in 5 Minutes

Have you ever wondered how your favorite YouTubers maintain the exact same "look" across every single video? They don't grade every clip from scratch. Instead, they use a **LUT** (Look Up Table). A LUT is essentially a preset that tells your editing software how to transform the colors of your footage to achieve a specific style.

While you can buy LUT packs online, creating your own ensures your brand looks unique. In this guide, we’ll show you how to create your own professional LUT in just 5 minutes using Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve.

## 1. Setting Up Your Reference Frame
Before you start grading, you need a "hero" shot.
1.  Choose a clip that is well-exposed and has a neutral white balance.
2.  Find a frame that has skin tones, some shadows, and some highlights. This ensures your LUT works well across the entire dynamic range.

## 2. The Basic Correction (The Foundation)
You can't build a house on sand, and you can't build a LUT on uncorrected footage.
*   **Fix Exposure:** Adjust the highlights and shadows so you have a full range of data.
*   **White Balance:** Ensure the whites are truly white.
*   **Contrast:** Add a slight S-curve to the luma curve to give the image some "pop."

## 3. The Creative Grade (The "Look")
This is where you give the video its personality.
*   **Color Wheels:** Want a "Cinematic" look? Add a bit of Teal to the shadows and Orange to the highlights.
*   **Saturation:** Instead of boosting global saturation, try "Vibrance" or "Saturation vs Saturation" curves to target only the muted colors.
*   **HSL Curves:** If you want that "moody" look, go to the Green and Yellow hues and lower their saturation.

## 4. Exporting Your LUT (.CUBE)
Once you are happy with the look, it's time to save it as a file that you can use in any project.

### In Premiere Pro:
1.  Go to the **Lumetri Color** panel.
2.  Click the three lines (hamburger menu) next to the "Lumetri Color" name.
3.  Select **"Export .cube."**
4.  Save it to your "Assets" folder.

### In DaVinci Resolve:
1.  Go to the **Color** page.
2.  Right-click on the thumbnail of the clip you just graded.
3.  Select **"Generate LUT -> 33 Point Cube."**

## 5. Testing and Refining
A common mistake is creating a LUT that is too "heavy." If you apply your LUT to a different shot and it looks terrible, you need to dial it back.

**Natural Mention:** Adding subtle light leaks or textures from sites like [EditorVault](https://editorvault.web.app) can really elevate the production value when combined with your custom LUT. Sometimes a "flat" LUT needs a bit of organic texture (like film grain or a lens flare) to really feel professional. I often apply my custom LUT and then layer an asset from EditorVault to finish the look.

## Conclusion
Creating your own LUTs is the fastest way to build a consistent visual brand. It saves you hours of work in post-production and ensures that every video you upload has your "signature" style. Start simple, focus on natural skin tones, and don't be afraid to experiment. Once you have a library of 3-4 custom LUTs, your editing speed will double overnight.

## Key Takeaways
*   A LUT is a mathematical preset for color transformation.
*   Always start with a clean, well-exposed reference frame.
*   Apply basic corrections before creative grading.
*   Export as a `.cube` file for universal compatibility.
*   Combine your custom LUTs with EditorVault assets for a polished look.
