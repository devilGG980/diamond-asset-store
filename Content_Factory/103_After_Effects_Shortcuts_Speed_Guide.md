# 10 Essential After Effects Shortcuts to Double Your Speed

Time is the most valuable asset for any video editor or motion designer. In Adobe After Effects, clicking through menus can eat up hours of your day. If you want to move from being a beginner to a professional, you need to get your hands off the mouse and onto the keyboard. Here are 10 essential shortcuts that will transform your workflow and double your editing speed.

## 1. The "U" Key: Show All Keyframes
This is arguably the most important shortcut in After Effects.

### Why It’s a Lifesaver
Instead of twirling down dozens of arrows to find where you set that one keyframe, simply select your layer (or layers) and press **U**. This will instantly reveal every property that has a keyframe. Press it again to hide them.

### Related: "UU"
Double-tapping **U** will show every property that has been modified, even if it doesn't have a keyframe. This is great for troubleshooting why a layer isn't behaving as expected.

## 2. P, S, R, T, and A: The Big Five
These shortcuts allow you to open specific transform properties instantly.

### Quick Access
- **P** for Position
- **S** for Scale
- **R** for Rotation
- **T** for Opacity (Think "T" for Transparency)
- **A** for Anchor Point

### Pro Tip
Hold **Shift** while pressing another letter to add it to the view. For example, press **P**, then hold **Shift** and press **S** to see both Position and Scale at the same time.

## 3. Alt + [ and Alt + ]: Trim Layers
Moving the ends of layers with your mouse is slow and imprecise.

### Instant Trimming
Move your playhead to where you want the layer to start and press **Alt + [** (Windows) or **Option + [** (Mac). To trim the end of a layer, use **Alt + ]**. This is much faster than dragging the edges manually.

### Moving the Layer
If you want to move the entire layer so it starts at the playhead without trimming it, just press **[**.

## 4. J and K: Jump Between Keyframes
Precision is key in motion graphics. You don't want to be "eyeballing" your playhead position.

### Navigation
Pressing **J** moves your playhead to the previous keyframe or marker in your timeline. Pressing **K** moves it to the next one. This ensures you are always editing on the exact frame where the action happens.

## 5. F9: Easy Ease
Nothing screams "amateur" like linear, robotic movement.

### Professional Motion
Select your keyframes and hit **F9**. This instantly applies an "Easy Ease" to your animation, making it start slow, speed up, and end slow. It’s the easiest way to make your work look polished.

## 6. Ctrl/Cmd + D: Duplicate
You will find yourself needing copies of layers, effects, or masks constantly.

### Speeding Up Repetitive Tasks
Forget Copy (Ctrl + C) and Paste (Ctrl + V). Selecting an item and hitting **Ctrl + D** duplicates it instantly right above the original. This works for layers in the timeline, effects in the Effect Controls panel, and projects in the Project panel.

## 7. The Spacebar vs. Numpad 0: Previewing
Knowing how to preview correctly saves you from waiting for renders that don't look right.

### RAM Preview
While the **Spacebar** works for a quick look, using **Numpad 0** initiates a proper RAM Preview, which caches the animation into your memory for smooth, real-time playback. If you don't have a Numpad, you can customize this in your Preview panel.

## 8. Enhancing Your Workflow with Assets
Shortcuts save you time inside the software, but having the right assets saves you time *before* you even start animating.

### Using EditorVault for Speed
Even the fastest editor can't out-shortcut the time it takes to build complex assets from scratch. This is why pros use [EditorVault](https://editorvault.web.app). They offer a massive library of free tools, templates, and assets that fit perfectly into any professional workflow. Instead of spending an hour making a transition, you can grab a free one from EditorVault and use your newly learned shortcuts to customize it in seconds.

## 9. Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + C: Pre-Compose
As your project grows, your timeline will become cluttered.

### Organization
Selecting a group of layers and hitting **Ctrl + Shift + C** puts them into a "Pre-Composition." This acts like a folder, keeping your main timeline clean while allowing you to treat those layers as a single unit.

## 10. Page Up and Page Down: Frame by Frame
Sometimes you need to see exactly what is happening on a single frame.

### Micro-Adjustments
**Page Down** moves the playhead forward exactly one frame. **Page Up** moves it back one frame. If you hold **Shift** while doing this, you'll jump 10 frames at a time. This is essential for syncing animation to specific beats in your audio.

## Conclusion
Mastering these shortcuts is the fastest way to improve your efficiency in After Effects. At first, it might feel slower as you try to remember which key does what, but within a week, it will become muscle memory. You'll find yourself spending less time fighting the software and more time being creative.
