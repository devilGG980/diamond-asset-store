## How to Choose the Right Software for You

When choosing your editor in 2026, consider these three factors:

Are you making 15-second TikToks or 20-minute documentaries?
- **TikTok/Reels:** CapCut is the winner.
- **YouTube Tutorials:** Premiere Pro or Descript.

### 3. Your Learning Commitment
Are you willing to spend 20 hours learning the software, or do you want to start editing in 5 minutes?
- **Immediate:** CapCut, Descript.
- **Moderate:** Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro.
- **Intensive:** DaVinci Resolve, Avid.
