# How to Create a Custom Color Preset (LUT) in 5 Minutes

Color grading is one of the most effective ways to give your videos a unique "signature" look. While there are thousands of LUT (Look-Up Table) packs available for purchase online, the most successful creators often build their own. A custom LUT ensures your content doesn't look like a carbon copy of everyone else’s and allows you to maintain brand consistency across different shooting environments.

The best part? You don't need to be a professional colorist to create one. Here is how you can build a custom color preset in just five minutes.

## 1. What is a LUT, Anyway?

Before we start building, it's important to understand what a LUT actually does. Think of a LUT as a "math filter." It tells your software: "Whenever you see this specific shade of red, change it to this specific shade of orange." 

### The Two Types of LUTs
*   **Technical LUTs:** These convert footage from one color space to another (e.g., Log to Rec.709).
*   **Creative LUTs:** These add the "mood"—the teal and orange, the vintage film look, or the high-contrast drama. This is what we are building today.

## 2. Setting Up Your Reference Clip

To create a LUT that actually works, you need a "Hero Clip."

### Choosing the Right Footage
Choose a clip that is well-exposed and has a good range of colors (skin tones, shadows, and highlights). If you create a LUT based on a clip that is too dark, it won't look good on your bright outdoor footage.

### The Fix
Perform a basic **Color Correction** first. Adjust your exposure, white balance, and contrast until the image looks natural. You want your "Creative LUT" to be applied to a "neutral" base.

## 3. The 5-Minute Grading Process

Now for the fun part. Using the Lumetri Color panel (Premiere) or the Color Wheels (Resolve), follow these steps to build your look:

### Minute 1: The Contrast Curve
Go to the **Curves** panel. Create a subtle "S-Curve." Pull the bottom-left corner down slightly to deepen shadows and push the top-right corner up to brighten highlights. This adds "pop" without losing detail.

### Minute 2: Temperature and Tint
Give your video a mood. Want it to feel warm and nostalgic? Push the temperature slider toward yellow/orange. Want it to feel "scarcity" or "techy"? Push it toward blue.

### Minute 3: HSL Secondary (Color Isolation)
This is where the magic happens. Go to the **HSL Secondary** or **Color Warper** tool. 
*   Select the **Greens** and shift them toward a more "forest" or "mint" look. 
*   Select the **Blues** and shift them toward "Teal."
*   **Crucial:** Always check your skin tones. If your skin tones start looking green or purple, dial it back.

### Minute 4: Shadow/Highlight Tinting
Use the **Color Wheels**. Add a tiny bit of Teal or Blue to the **Shadows** and a tiny bit of Orange or Yellow to the **Highlights**. This is the classic Hollywood "Teal and Orange" look.

### Minute 5: Final Refinement
Check your **Vectorscope**. Ensure your colors aren't "bleeding" out of the safe zones. Adjust the overall saturation until the look feels professional, not overdone.

## 4. Exporting Your Look as a .CUBE File

Once you’re happy with the look, it’s time to save it so you can use it on any future project.

### In Premiere Pro:
1.  Go to the **Lumetri Color** panel.
2.  Click the three lines (hamburger menu) next to the "Lumetri Color" title.
3.  Select **"Export .cube"**.
4.  Save it in a folder you won't delete!

### In DaVinci Resolve:
1.  Right-click the thumbnail of the clip you just graded.
2.  Select **"Generate LUT > 33 Point / 65 Point Cube"**.
3.  Give it a name and save it.

## 5. How to Use Your New LUT Correctly

When you apply your custom LUT to a new project, it might not look perfect immediately.

### The "Intensity" Slider
Always apply your LUT at 100% first to see the effect, then dial the intensity (or opacity) down to around **60-80%**. This makes the look feel more integrated with the footage.

### Consistency is Key
For creators who want to take their branding even further, using consistent visual assets is vital. You can find free overlays, textures, and templates to complement your custom LUTs at [EditorVault](https://editorvault.web.app).

## Conclusion

Creating your own LUT is a rite of passage for serious video editors. It moves you away from "one-click" solutions and into the realm of intentional storytelling. By spending just five minutes building a look that is uniquely yours, you increase the production value of your videos and build a more recognizable brand.

Now, go forth and color!
