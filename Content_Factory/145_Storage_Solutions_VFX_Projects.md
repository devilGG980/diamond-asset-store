# Best Storage Solutions for Large VFX Projects

In the world of Visual Effects (VFX), "storage" isn't just a place to keep your files—it's a critical part of your performance. Working with 4K RAW footage, hundreds of high-res textures, and massive "Disk Cache" files will quickly overwhelm a standard hard drive. If your storage is slow, your After Effects timeline will lag, and your renders will take forever. In 2026, the standard has shifted toward high-speed NVMe and redundant NAS systems. Here is our guide to the best storage solutions for large VFX projects.

## 1. The "Three-Drive" Workflow (The Pro Standard)
For maximum performance in After Effects, you should never run everything off one drive.

### Drive 1: The System Drive (OS & Apps)
This should be a fast NVMe SSD (at least 1TB). It’s solely for Windows/macOS and your Adobe applications.

### Drive 2: The Project Drive (Footage & Assets)
This is where your active project files and original 4K footage live. This needs to be your fastest drive (NVMe Gen 4 or Gen 5). If the drive can't "read" the footage fast enough, you'll see "stuttering" during playback.

### Drive 3: The Cache Drive (The Secret Weapon)
After Effects needs a place to store its temporary "preview" files (the Disk Cache). You should have a dedicated NVMe SSD just for this. If your cache is on the same drive as your footage, the drive's "read/write" heads will be fighting each other, slowing everything down.

## 2. Best Portable SSDs for Creators
If you're a freelancer moving between studios or working on a laptop, you need high-speed external storage.

### Samsung T7 Shield / T9
The T7 Shield is the industry favorite for a reason: it’s fast (1,050 MB/s), rugged, and reliable. The newer T9 offers double the speed (2,000 MB/s), which is perfect for working directly off the drive with high-bitrate footage.

### SanDisk Professional PRO-G40
If you need absolute speed, the PRO-G40 uses Thunderbolt 3 to achieve speeds up to 3,000 MB/s. It’s expensive, but it allows you to edit 8K footage as if it were stored internally on your computer.

## 3. Best Desktop Storage (RAID Systems)
As your project library grows, you’ll eventually run out of space on individual SSDs. This is where RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) comes in.

### OWC ThunderBay
The ThunderBay series allows you to put multiple hard drives or SSDs into one box. By using "RAID 5," you can combine the speed of multiple drives while ensuring that if one drive fails, you don't lose any data. It’s the "safety net" for professional studios.

### G-Technology (SanDisk Professional) G-RAID
Famous for their "removable" drive bays, G-RAID systems are the standard in Hollywood post-production houses. They are built for 24/7 reliability and feature high-end Enterprise-class hard drives.

## 4. Best Network Storage (NAS)
If you have multiple people working on the same project, you need a NAS (Network Attached Storage).

### QNAP and Synology (10GbE)
A NAS like the **Synology DS1823xs+** allows everyone in your office to access the same footage over a high-speed (10GbE) network. In 2026, 10GbE is a requirement for VFX work; a standard 1Gb network is far too slow for 4K video editing.

## 5. Speeding Up Your Storage with Efficient Assets
Having massive storage is great, but the smartest way to manage space is to use assets that are already optimized.

### Discovering EditorVault
Building every complex asset from scratch creates massive "cache" and "temp" files that eat up your storage. [EditorVault](https://editorvault.web.app) is an incredible resource for storage-conscious creators. They offer high-quality, pre-rendered assets like transitions, overlays, and sound effects. Because these are provided as highly-compressed yet high-quality video files, they take up very little space compared to "raw" simulations or uncompressed sequences. Using an asset from EditorVault allows you to maintain a professional look while keeping your "Project Drive" lean and your "Cache Drive" from filling up in an hour. It’s the perfect way to balance production value and storage efficiency.

## 6. Cloud Backup: The "Off-Site" Requirement
"RAID is not a backup." If your office floods or your RAID controller fails, you could lose everything.

### Backblaze and Frame.io
- **Backblaze:** Offers "unlimited" cloud backup for your entire computer and all attached drives for a small monthly fee. It’s the "set it and forget it" solution.
- **Frame.io (Adobe):** Included with Creative Cloud, Frame.io is perfect for backing up specific "active" project files and sharing them with clients for feedback.

## 7. Storage Maintenance Tips
- **The 80% Rule:** Never fill an SSD more than 80% full. Once they reach capacity, their performance drops significantly.
- **Purge Your Cache:** Every Friday, go to After Effects > Purge > **All Memory & Disk Cache**. This will delete old preview files and free up hundreds of gigabytes.
- **3-2-1 Backup Strategy:** Have **3** copies of your data, on **2** different types of media, with **1** copy stored **off-site** (in the cloud).

## Conclusion
Storage is the foundation of your VFX workstation. By implementing a "Three-Drive" workflow and using high-speed NVMe storage, you can remove the "bottleneck" that slows down your creativity. Combine your powerful storage with high-quality, optimized assets, and you'll spend more time creating and less time waiting for bars to load.
