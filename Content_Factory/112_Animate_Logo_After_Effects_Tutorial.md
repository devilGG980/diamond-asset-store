# How to Animate a Logo in After Effects (Step-by-Step)

A professional logo animation is one of the most effective ways to brand your video content. It adds a "premium" feel to your intros and outros and makes your brand memorable. While you can buy templates, learning to animate a logo from scratch gives you total creative control. In this step-by-step guide, we’ll take a static logo and turn it into a dynamic motion piece.

## Step 1: Preparing Your Logo
Before you even open After Effects, you need to make sure your logo is ready for animation.

### The Importance of Vector Files
Always use an **Adobe Illustrator (.ai)** file. If your logo is a flat JPEG or PNG, you can only move the whole thing at once. With an Illustrator file, you can separate the icon, the text, and the tagline into different layers, allowing you to animate each part individually.

### Importing into After Effects
When you import your .ai file, choose **Import As: Composition - Retain Layer Sizes**. This ensures each part of your logo has its anchor point centered on the object rather than the center of the entire screen.

## Step 2: Setting the "End State"
The best way to animate a logo is to work backward.

### Position the Logo
Place your logo exactly where you want it to end up in the final animation. Set your keyframes (Position, Scale, Rotation, Opacity) at the 2-second or 3-second mark. This is your "resting position."

### Moving to the Start
Now, move your playhead back to 0 seconds. Change the values to where the animation should start. For example, scale the icon to 0% and move the text off-screen. After Effects will automatically fill in the movement.

## Step 3: Adding a "Bounce" and "Ease"
Linear movement looks robotic. We want our logo to feel like it has weight and life.

### The Graph Editor
Select all your keyframes and press **F9** (Easy Ease). Then, open the **Graph Editor**. Pull the handles of your ending keyframes to the left to create a "snappy" motion where the logo arrives quickly and then slowly settles.

### Overshooting
For a more playful feel, set an extra Scale keyframe that is slightly larger (e.g., 110%) just before the final 100% keyframe. This makes the logo "pop" and settle.

## Step 4: Animating the Individual Elements
Don't make everything happen at once. Stagger your layers.

### The Offset Trick
Offset your layers by a few frames. Let the icon appear first, followed by the main text, and finally the tagline. This "waterfall" effect is much more visually interesting than a single, simultaneous appearance.

## Step 5: Adding Visual Flare
Now that the basic movement is done, let's make it look professional.

### Trim Paths for Outlines
If your logo has a stroke or outline, use the **Trim Paths** operator (found inside Shape Layers). This allows you to "draw" the outline of the logo onto the screen. It’s one of the most popular logo animation techniques.

### Motion Blur
Enable the **Motion Blur** switch for all your layers. This adds a realistic blur to the fast-moving parts, making the animation feel smooth and high-quality.

## Step 6: Enhancing with Professional Assets
Even a simple logo animation can be elevated with the right background and sound effects.

### Leveling Up with EditorVault
Building a professional background from scratch can be time-consuming. [EditorVault](https://editorvault.web.app) is an incredible resource for logo animators. They offer a variety of free assets, including stylized backgrounds, light leaks, and professional sound effects (SFX). A logo animation without a "swoosh" or "pop" sound feels empty. By grabbing a free SFX pack from EditorVault and layering it with your animation, you can create a high-end brand reveal in a fraction of the time.

## Step 7: Exporting with Transparency
If you want to use your logo animation on top of other videos, you need to export it correctly.

### The Alpha Channel
Go to File > Export > Add to Render Queue. In the Output Module, choose a format that supports transparency (like **QuickTime** with the **Apple ProRes 4444** codec). Make sure the Channels are set to **RGB + Alpha**.

## Conclusion
Animating a logo is a fantastic way to learn the core principles of motion graphics: timing, easing, and layering. By following this step-by-step process, you can turn any brand mark into an engaging piece of video content that leaves a lasting impression.
