# 5 Simple VFX You Can Create in After Effects Today

When people hear "Visual Effects" (VFX), they often think of millions of dollars and massive computer farms. But you don’t need a Hollywood budget to create stunning effects. Adobe After Effects is a powerhouse for VFX, and many professional-looking tricks are surprisingly simple to execute. Here are five VFX you can create today, even if you’re a beginner.

## 1. The "Invisible" Sky Replacement
Changing a boring, gray sky into a beautiful sunset or a dramatic starry night is one of the most common and effective VFX.

### How to do it:
1. Use the **Luma Key** or **Color Range** effect to select the sky area of your footage.
2. If the sky is a solid color, you can often just use a mask.
3. Place your new sky image or video on a layer *behind* your main footage.
4. Add a bit of **Gaussian Blur** to the sky to match the depth of field of your lens.

## 2. Realistic Screen Replacement
Want to put your own logo or video onto a laptop or phone screen in your footage? You don't need to hold the camera perfectly still.

### How to do it:
1. Use the **Mocha AE** plugin (which comes free with After Effects).
2. Track the four corners of the screen in your footage.
3. Export the tracking data to a "Corner Pin" effect on your new video layer.
4. Set the blending mode of the screen layer to "Screen" or "Lighten" so that real-world reflections stay visible on top of your video.

## 3. The "Flash" Super Speed Effect
Creating a "speedster" effect like The Flash is a classic beginner VFX project that looks amazing.

### How to do it:
1. Film yourself running across the frame (use a tripod!).
2. Cut the clip to just a few frames long so you move very fast.
3. Apply the **Echo** effect. This creates trails behind you.
4. Set the "Echo Operator" to "Composite in Back" and increase the "Number of Echoes" for a longer trail.

## 4. Digital Glitch and Distortion
Glitch effects are perfect for sci-fi, horror, or high-energy music videos.

### How to do it:
1. Create a "Solid" layer and apply the **Fractal Noise** effect.
2. Increase the contrast and set the noise type to "Block."
3. Pre-compose this solid.
4. Apply the **Displacement Map** effect to your footage and select the noise Pre-Comp as the source.
5. Animate the displacement amount to create random, digital-looking jumps and tears.

## 5. Adding Cinematic Atmosphere (Dust & Fog)
Sometimes a shot just looks too "clean." Adding atmospheric elements can give it a high-budget, cinematic feel.

### How to do it:
1. Find a video of dust particles or fog on a black background.
2. Place it over your footage.
3. Change the blending mode to **Screen**. This hides the black and keeps the white particles.
4. Lower the opacity and add a subtle **Tint** to match the color of your scene.

## Boosting Your VFX with Professional Assets
The secret to great VFX is often combining your own work with high-quality, pre-made elements.
