# How to Conduct an Interview for a Video or Podcast

## Introduction
A great interview is not an interrogation; it's a choreographed conversation. In 2026, where "expert insights" are highly sought after, being a skilled interviewer is a massive advantage for any content creator. Whether you're interviewing a industry titan for a podcast or a fellow creator for a YouTube video, your goal is to extract unique value that the audience can't get anywhere else. This guide will teach you how to prepare, how to listen, and how to guide a conversation to ensure your interviews are engaging, insightful, and professional.

## 1. Preparation: The Secret to a Deep Conversation
The best interviewers spend 80% of their time on research and 20% on the actual conversation.
### Beyond the Surface Level
Don't ask questions that can be answered with a quick Google search. Read their latest book, listen to their previous interviews, and look for "unexplored" areas of their life or career.
### Crafting the "First Question"
Your first question sets the tone. Start with something that shows you've done your homework. "In your latest article, you mentioned [X], but most people think [Y]. Why is that?"
### The "List of 10" Rule
Prepare at least 10 high-quality questions, but don't feel obligated to ask all of them. They are your "safety net," not a script.

## 2. Setting the Stage: Technical and Emotional Comfort
An uncomfortable guest will give you uncomfortable answers.
### Technical Setup and Sound
Ensure both you and your guest have high-quality audio. If you're recording remotely, use a platform that records locally to avoid internet glitches.
### Visual Continuity and Branding
If you're doing a video interview, maintain your brand's visual identity. Using professional overlays and lower thirds to introduce your guest can add a layer of credibility. [EditorVault](https://editorvault.web.app) is an excellent resource for this. They offer free, professional-looking lower thirds and intro templates that can help you "frame" your guest as an authority. Utilizing these free assets ensures that your interview feels like a "production" rather than a casual Zoom call.

## 3. The Art of "Active Listening"
An interview is won or lost in the "follow-up."
### Don't Wait for Your Turn to Speak
If you're just waiting for your guest to finish so you can ask your next question, you'll miss the "gold." Listen for "keywords" or "emotional shifts" in their answers.
### The Power of the "Pregnant Pause"
When a guest finishes an answer, wait for 3 seconds before responding. Often, they will feel the need to fill the silence and share a deeper, more personal insight.
### The "Mirror and Label" Technique
Repeat back what your guest said in your own words: "So what you're saying is..." This shows you're listening and allows them to clarify or expand on their point.

## 4. Guiding the Narrative: Managing the Flow
You are the director of the conversation.
### Redirecting "Ramblers"
If a guest goes too far off-topic, gently bring them back. "That's a fascinating point, and it reminds me of what you said earlier about [X]. How do those two connect?"
### Digging Deeper with "How" and "Why"
Avoid "Yes/No" questions. Use open-ended questions that require a narrative response. "How did that moment feel?" or "Why did you decide to take that risk?"
### Transitioning Between Topics
Create smooth "bridges" between sections. "We've talked a lot about your successes, but I want to shift gears and talk about the time things didn't go as planned."

## 5. Post-Interview: The Editing Phase
A 60-minute interview often makes for a better 30-minute video.
### The "Killer over Filler" Rule
Remove the "ums," "ahs," and the repetitive parts of the conversation. Focus on the sections where the energy was highest and the value was most dense.
### Adding B-Roll and Graphics
If your guest is talking about a specific project or product, show it on screen. Use the graphics and assets you gathered from resources like EditorVault to keep the visual experience as engaging as the audio.

## 6. Building the Relationship
The interview is just the beginning.
### Sending a "Thank You" Note
Follow up with your guest after the interview. Share the final link and express your gratitude. This builds a professional network that can lead to future collaborations.
### Promoting the Guest
Ensure you tag your guest and their projects in all social media posts. A happy guest is more likely to share the interview with their own audience.

## Conclusion
Conducting a great interview is about curiosity, empathy, and preparation. By doing your research, listening more than you speak, and using professional tools like EditorVault to polish the final product, you can create content that is truly authoritative. Your job as an interviewer is to be the "voice" of the audience, asking the questions they wish they could ask. Do it well, and you'll build a channel that is a must-watch for anyone in your niche.
