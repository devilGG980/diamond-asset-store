# Top 10 Best External Hard Drives for Video Editors (2026 Guide)

If you are a video editor, your data is your lifeblood. A single 4K project can easily exceed 200GB, and high-resolution raw footage can reach the terabytes within a few days of shooting. Relying on your computer's internal storage is a recipe for a "Disk Full" error and a massive performance slowdown.

In 2026, the market is split between **SSDs** (Solid State Drives) for active editing and **HDDs** (Hard Disk Drives) for long-term archiving. In this guide, we’ve rounded up the top 10 best external drives for video editors based on speed, reliability, and price.

## 1. The Gold Standard: Samsung T7 Shield (SSD)

The Samsung T7 series has been a favorite for years, and the "Shield" version adds a rugged, rubberized exterior that protects against drops and water.

*   **Speed:** Up to 1,050 MB/s.
*   **Best For:** Active editing of 4K H.264/H.265 footage.
*   **Price:** Around $150 for 2TB.

## 2. The Speed King: SanDisk Professional PRO-G40 (SSD)

If you are editing high-bitrate ProRes or RAW footage, you need more than standard USB speeds. The PRO-G40 uses Thunderbolt 3 to achieve incredible speeds.

*   **Speed:** Up to 3,000 MB/s.
*   **Best For:** Professional editors working on high-end desktop workstations or MacBooks.
*   **Price:** Around $300 for 2TB.

## 3. The Professional Choice: G-Technology ArmorLock (SSD)

Data security is vital for professional projects. The ArmorLock drive allows you to lock and unlock the drive using your smartphone's face ID or fingerprint.

*   **Speed:** Up to 1,000 MB/s.
*   **Best For:** Editors handling sensitive client data or commercial projects.
*   **Price:** Around $250 for 2TB.

## 4. The Budget SSD: Crucial X9 Pro

Crucial offers some of the best price-to-performance ratios in the industry. The X9 Pro is incredibly small (fits in your pocket) but packs enough punch for most 1080p and 4K workflows.

*   **Speed:** Up to 1,050 MB/s.
*   **Best For:** Beginner YouTubers and travel vloggers.
*   **Price:** Often under $120 for 2TB.

## 5. The Ultimate Archiving Drive: WD My Book (HDD)

For long-term storage, you don't need SSD speeds; you need massive capacity at a low price. The WD My Book is a "desktop" drive that stays on your desk.

*   **Speed:** Up to 160 MB/s.
*   **Best For:** Backing up finished projects and storing raw B-roll.
*   **Price:** Around $280 for 14TB.

## 6. The Rugged Classic: LaCie Rugged Mini (HDD)

You’ve likely seen these orange drives on film sets for decades. They are slow (being HDDs), but they are incredibly durable.

*   **Speed:** Up to 130 MB/s.
*   **Best For:** Field work where you just need to dump footage from an SD card to a safe place.
*   **Price:** Around $110 for 4TB.

## 7. The Portable Archive: Seagate One Touch (HDD)

If you need to carry 5TB of data in your pocket but can't afford a 5TB SSD, this is the best compromise.

*   **Speed:** Up to 120 MB/s.
*   **Best For:** Carrying your entire library of assets and sound effects.
*   **Price:** Around $120 for 5TB.

## 8. The High-Performance Desktop Hub: SanDisk Professional G-DRIVE

This is a professional desktop HDD designed for 24/7 operation. It features a fast 7200RPM enterprise-class drive inside.

*   **Speed:** Up to 280 MB/s.
*   **Best For:** Dedicated editing workstations where you need a reliable primary storage drive.
*   **Price:** $400+ for 18TB.

## 9. The Extreme Performance: OWC Envoy Pro FX

This is the "tank" of the SSD world. It is waterproof, drop-proof, and works with both USB and Thunderbolt at their maximum possible speeds.

*   **Speed:** Up to 2,800 MB/s.
*   **Best For:** Extreme environments and high-end cinematic workflows.
*   **Price:** $350+ for 2TB.

## 10. The DIY Choice: NVMe Enclosure + SSD

Many pro editors buy a "bare" NVMe SSD (like a Samsung 990 Pro) and put it inside a USB4 enclosure (like those from Acasis or Satechi).

*   **Speed:** Up to 3,500 MB/s.
*   **Best For:** Tech-savvy editors who want the absolute fastest speeds for the lowest price.
*   **Price:** Variable (approx $200 for 2TB).

## Summary: SSD vs. HDD for Editors

*   **Edit from an SSD:** Never try to edit 4K video directly from an HDD. The "lag" will make you want to quit. Use an SSD like the **Samsung T7** or **SanDisk Extreme** for your active project.
*   **Archive to an HDD:** Once the project is finished, move it to a large HDD like the **WD My Book**. It’s much cheaper per terabyte.
*   **The 3-2-1 Rule:** Always have **3** copies of your data, on **2** different types of media (e.g., SSD and Cloud), with **1** copy stored off-site.
