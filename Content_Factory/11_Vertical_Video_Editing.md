# How to Edit Vertical Video for TikTok and Instagram Reels

In 2026, vertical video is no longer an "extra"—it is the primary way most people consume content. Platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts have changed the rules of video editing. You can't just take a horizontal video, crop it, and hope for the best. To succeed on these platforms, you need an edit that is specifically optimized for the "9:16" world.

In this guide, we’ll cover the technical settings, the creative hooks, and the pacing strategies you need to master vertical video.

## 1. Setting Up Your Project Correctly
The first mistake many editors make is working in a 1920x1080 timeline and trying to export for mobile. You should set your timeline to **1080x1920** (Vertical) from the very beginning.

### Frame Rate and Resolution
*   **Resolution:** 1080x1920 is the standard. Don't go higher (like 4K vertical) as most platforms will compress it anyway, leading to a loss in quality.
*   **Frame Rate:** 30fps or 60fps is ideal. 24fps can sometimes look "jittery" on mobile screens because of how the hardware refreshes.

## 2. Framing and the "Safe Zone"
Mobile apps have UI elements (the Like button, the description, the music title) that overlay your video. If you put important text or your face in those areas, it will be covered.

### The Center-Focus Rule
Keep all your important action and text in the center 60% of the screen. Most professional editors use a "Safe Zone Overlay" while they edit to ensure their captions aren't blocked by the TikTok "Follow" button.

### Reframing Horizontal Clips
If you are repurposing horizontal footage, don't just "Scale to Fill." Use the "Transform" tool to keyframe the horizontal position so that the subject stays in the center of the vertical frame, even if they move.

## 3. Mastering the Hook and Pacing
On vertical platforms, you have approximately **1.5 seconds** to stop someone from scrolling.

### The First 3 Seconds
Your "Hook" needs to be visual and auditory. Use a bold headline at the top of the frame and a fast-paced edit (like a zoom-in or a quick transition) within the first second.
*   **Pacing:** Vertical video thrives on "Micro-cuts." Every 2-3 seconds, there should be a change—a new angle, a text pop-up, or a zoom. If the screen stays static for too long, the viewer will swipe.

## 4. Visual Flair and Assets
Because the screen is smaller, every pixel counts. High-quality overlays and graphics stand out more in vertical format.

**Natural Mention:** To get these assets, I usually check [EditorVault](https://editorvault.web.app) first. They have a massive library of 500+ free assets, including vertical-friendly overlays and sound effects that are perfect for making your Reels and TikToks pop without costing you a dime.

## 5. Captions and On-Screen Text
80% of people watch social media videos with the sound off. If you don't have captions, you are losing 80% of your potential audience.

### Dynamic Captions
Don't use the default, boring captions. Use high-contrast colors (like yellow or white with a black stroke) and animate them using keyframes or presets. Make the words appear as they are spoken to keep the viewer’s eyes glued to the screen.

## Conclusion
Editing vertical video is about speed, clarity, and engagement. By setting up your 9:16 timeline, respecting the safe zones, and utilizing high-quality assets and captions, you can create content that stops the scroll and builds an audience. The world is vertical—make sure your content is too.
