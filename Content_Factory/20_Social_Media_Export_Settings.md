# Best Practices for Exporting Video for Social Media (2026 Settings)

You've spent hours editing, color grading, and sound designing your masterpiece. But if you use the wrong export settings, the social media platform’s compression algorithm will tear your video apart, leaving it blurry, desaturated, or "blocky."

Exporting is the final hurdle. In 2026, the "best" settings have shifted as platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok have upgraded their backends. Here is the definitive guide to exporting for social media.

## 1. The General Rule: High Bitrate is King
The most important setting in your export window is the **Bitrate**. Think of bitrate as the "amount of data" allowed per second of video. If the bitrate is too low, you lose detail.

### Recommended Bitrates for 2026:
*   **1080p (Social Media):** 15-20 Mbps
*   **4K (YouTube):** 45-60 Mbps
*   **Vertical Video (TikTok/Reels):** 10-15 Mbps

Exporting at a slightly higher bitrate than the platform recommends is a good strategy. It gives the platform "more to work with" when it compresses your file for its servers.

## 2. Choosing the Right Codec: H.264 vs H.265
For 99% of social media use cases, **H.264** is still the standard. It provides the best balance between file size and compatibility. However, if you are uploading 4K or 8K content to YouTube, **H.265 (HEVC)** is superior because it retains more color detail at the same file size.

### Settings Checklist:
*   **Format:** H.264
*   **Resolution:** 1920x1080 (for most) or 1080x1920 (for vertical)
*   **Frame Rate:** Match your source (usually 23.976, 24, 30, or 60)
*   **Field Order:** Progressive
*   **Aspect Ratio:** Square Pixels (1.0)

## 3. Platform-Specific Optimization
Different platforms handle video differently.

### YouTube (The High Quality Leader)
YouTube allows for the highest quality. Always check **"Render at Maximum Depth"** and **"Use Maximum Render Quality."** This ensures that your color gradients stay smooth and don't "break" into bands of color (banding).

### Instagram & TikTok (The Compression Monsters)
These platforms are notorious for aggressive compression. To fight this:
*   Don't export in 4K for Instagram. Instagram will downscale it to 1080p using its own (often poor) algorithm. Exporting in high-quality 1080p directly from your NLE usually yields a sharper result on the app.
*   Keep your file size under 1GB for faster processing and less chance of an "Upload Failed" error.

## 4. Audio Export Settings
Don't neglect the sound! 
*   **Format:** AAC
*   **Sample Rate:** 48,000 Hz
*   **Channels:** Stereo
*   **Audio Quality:** High
*   **Bitrate:** 320 kbps

## 5. Speeding Up Your Workflow
Exporting can take a long time, especially for high-res projects. While you wait for that render bar to finish, it's the perfect time to start prepping for your *next* project.

**Natural Mention:** I've been using tools like [EditorVault](https://editorvault.web.app) lately to grab overlays quickly, which saved me a ton of time. While my current project is exporting, I'll often browse EditorVault for the assets I need for my next video, ensuring I can jump right into the next edit the moment the render is done.

## Conclusion
Exporting isn't just about hitting "Enter." It's about ensuring your hard work translates to the screen of your audience. By using H.264 at a high bitrate, matching your source frame rate, and optimizing for the specific quirks of each platform, you can ensure your videos look professional every single time. Don't let compression ruin your vision—export like a pro.

## Key Takeaways
*   Use H.264 for compatibility; H.265 for high-res color detail.
*   Set bitrates to 15-20 Mbps for 1080p and 45-60 Mbps for 4K.
*   Always "Render at Maximum Depth" to avoid color banding.
*   Export 1080p for Instagram to avoid their internal downscaling.
*   Use 320 kbps AAC for the best audio quality.
*   Use your render time productively by sourcing assets from EditorVault.
