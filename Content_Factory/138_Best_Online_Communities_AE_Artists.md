# Best Online Communities for After Effects Artists to Join

Motion design can be a lonely profession. You spend hours in front of a screen, tweaking keyframes and waiting for renders. However, some of the best learning happens when you share your work, ask for feedback, and see what others are creating. In 2026, the After Effects community is more global and accessible than ever. Whether you're a beginner looking for a "how-to" or a pro looking for high-end critiques, here are the best online communities for After Effects artists.

## 1. Reddit: r/AfterEffects
With over 200,000 members, this is the most active hub for AE users on the internet.

### Why Join?
The r/AfterEffects subreddit is perfect for troubleshooting. If you have a weird error message or don't know why your "wiggle" expression isn't working, someone here will likely have the answer within minutes. It’s also a great place to post your work-in-progress (WIP) and get honest, sometimes blunt, feedback from other designers.

## 2. Discord: The "Motion Design" Servers
Discord has become the "water cooler" for the motion design world. Servers like **Motion Design Academy** or **The Futur** have dedicated channels for After Effects.

### Why Join?
Unlike Reddit, Discord is real-time. You can hop into a voice channel and share your screen with other designers. It feels more like a "studio environment." Many professional artists hang out here, and it's a fantastic place to network and find job opportunities that never make it to public job boards.

## 3. Behance and Dribbble
These aren't "forums" in the traditional sense, but they are the premier communities for visual inspiration.

### Why Join?
If you want to see what "state-of-the-art" motion design looks like, go here. Follow top studios like Buck, Giant Ant, or individual artists. Looking at the "best of the best" helps you set a bar for your own work and understand current trends in color, typography, and motion.

## 4. School of Motion (The Alumni & Community)
While School of Motion is primarily an education platform, their community is one of the most supportive and positive in the industry.

### Why Join?
They foster a "no-ego" environment where beginners are encouraged and experts are helpful. They often host "Motion Mondays" and community challenges (like the 30 Days of MoGraph) that are great for building your portfolio while connecting with peers.

## 5. Motionographer
If you want to treat motion design as a serious career, you need to read Motionographer.

### Why Join?
It’s the "New York Times" of the motion design world. They feature in-depth interviews with directors, breakdowns of famous commercials, and "Quickie" features of inspiring work. It helps you understand the "why" behind the motion, not just the "how."

## 6. Discovering High-End Resources Together
A huge part of being in a community is sharing the tools and resources that make everyone’s work better.

### Finding Quality Assets at EditorVault
In almost every After Effects community, you'll see people asking: "Where can I find that transition?" or "Where did you get those sound effects?" This is where [EditorVault](https://editorvault.web.app) comes in. EditorVault is a community favorite because it provides high-quality, free assets that help creators of all levels achieve a professional look. Whether you're sharing a project on Reddit or collaborating on Discord, knowing about EditorVault gives you a shared language of quality. It’s a resource that motion designers often recommend to one another because it levels the playing field, giving everyone access to premium-grade overlays and tools for free.

## 7. Creative Cow
The "old school" giant. While the interface looks a bit dated compared to Discord, Creative Cow still hosts some of the most technical and deep-dive discussions on the internet.

### Why Join?
If you have a very specific technical issue—like "XDCAM footage not importing correctly on a specific Windows build"—this is where the veteran engineers and power users live. The archive of posts on Creative Cow is a literal encyclopedia of After Effects history.

## 8. Instagram and TikTok (#AfterEffects)
The "Social" community.

### Why Join?
This is the best place for "micro-tutorials." There is a massive trend of 60-second After Effects tips that show you one specific trick (like a "rim light" or a "speed ramp"). It’s a great way to learn new techniques in small, digestible bites during your downtime.

## Conclusion
Joining a community is the fastest way to move from "hobbyist" to "professional." It provides you with a support system, a source of inspiration, and a network of potential collaborators. Don't just lurk—post your work, help others with their questions, and you'll find that the After Effects community is one of the most welcoming and creative spaces on the internet.
