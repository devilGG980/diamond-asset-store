# Top 10 Best Script Packs for After Effects (EaseCopy, Flow, etc.)

In After Effects, there is a big difference between a "Plugin" and a "Script." While plugins usually create new visual effects (like particles or glows), **Scripts** are designed to automate tasks inside the interface. They are the ultimate "efficiency" tools. If you find yourself doing the same repetitive task three times—like copying keyframe easing or centering an anchor point—there is probably a script that can do it in one click. Here are the top 10 script packs you need to master After Effects in 2026.

## 1. Flow (Paid)
Flow is arguably the most important script for any motion designer. It provides a beautiful interface to the Graph Editor.

### Why You Need It:
Instead of manually tweaking handles in the Graph Editor, Flow allows you to apply "Easing Curves" with a single click. It comes with a library of presets and allows you to save your own "Signature" curves. It’s the fastest way to get that "snappy" motion graphics look.

## 2. EaseCopy (Free/Name Your Own Price)
Have you ever spent 10 minutes perfecting the easing of one layer and then realized you need that exact same "feel" on another layer?

### Why You Need It:
After Effects doesn't let you copy *just* the easing without copying the *values*. EaseCopy solves this. You can "Copy Ease" from one set of keyframes and "Paste Ease" onto another. It is a massive time-saver for complex animations.

## 3. Motion 4 (Paid)
Motion 4 is more than just a script; it’s a complete workflow overhaul. It puts all the most common tasks into one compact panel.

### Why You Need It:
From one-click anchor point alignment to a powerful "Expression Library," Motion 4 is the "Swiss Army Knife" of After Effects. It's often the first thing professional designers install on a new machine.

## 4. Overlord (Paid)
If you work between Illustrator and After Effects, Overlord is non-negotiable.

### Why You Need It:
It creates an "invisible bridge" between the two programs. You can select a shape in Illustrator and click one button to have it appear as a perfectly organized Shape Layer in After Effects. No more "Import File > Convert to Shapes."

## 5. AE Juice (Free & Paid Packs)
AE Juice is a library of hundreds of pre-made animations, transitions, and elements.

### Why You Need It:
It’s like having a library of "templates" inside your software. Their "Free Starter Pack" is surprisingly generous and includes essential items like transitions and liquid elements that are ready to drag and drop.

## 6. FX Console (Free)
Developed by Video Copilot, this is a "must-have" for every single AE user.

### Why You Need It:
By pressing **Ctrl + Space**, a search bar appears. You can type the name of any effect (e.g., "Fast Box Blur") and hit Enter to apply it instantly. It completely removes the need to use the slow "Effects & Presets" panel.

## 7. ButtCapper (Free)
A simple but genius script for anyone who works with strokes and lines.

### Why You Need It:
Changing a stroke from a "Butt Cap" (flat) to a "Round Cap" takes several clicks in the layer hierarchy. ButtCapper puts three simple icons on your screen to change the cap and join style in one click.

## 8. Reposition Anchor Point (Free)
One of the most common tasks in AE is moving the anchor point to a corner or the center of a layer.

### Why You Need It:
Instead of using the Pan Behind tool and "eyeballing" it, this script gives you a 9-point grid. Click the center square, and the anchor point snaps to the exact center.

## 9. Joysticks 'n Sliders (Paid)
This is the gold standard for character animation and head turns.

### Why You Need It:
It allows you to create 2D "controllers" for complex animations. You set your "extreme" poses (Look Left, Look Right, Look Up, Look Down), and the script creates a joystick that interpolates between them perfectly.

## 10. Leveling Up Your Workflow with Assets
Scripts make you faster, but high-quality assets make your work look better. The most efficient creators use a combination of both.

### Discovering EditorVault
While scripts like Flow and EaseCopy handle the "logic" of your movement, [EditorVault](https://editorvault.web.app) handles the "aesthetic." EditorVault is an incredible resource for designers who want to pair their fast scripted workflows with professional elements. They offer free asset packs, transitions, and overlays that fit perfectly into any scripted project. Imagine using Overlord to bring in a vector, Flow to animate it, and then a cinematic "dust" asset from EditorVault to give it that final, polished look. EditorVault is the perfect companion to a scripted, high-speed workflow.
